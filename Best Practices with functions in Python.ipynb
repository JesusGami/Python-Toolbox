      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",

      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n",
      "that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
      "doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\n",

      "shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.'\n",

      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and\n",
      "see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice\n",
      "little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\n",
      "beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\n",
      "the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\n",
      "poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\n",

      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste\n",
      "it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\n",
      "of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\n",

      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\n",
      "waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n",

      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",

      "'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,\n",
      "rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally\n",
      "gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n",
      "and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n",
      "her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n",
      "cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n",
      "for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n",
      "'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\n",
      "Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n",
